Septic abscesses can occur any-\\nwhere in the body. Only a germ and the body’s immune\\nresponse are required. In response to the invading germ,\\nwhite blood cells gather at the infected site and begin\\nproducing chemicals called enzymes that attack the germ\\nby digesting it. These enzymes act like acid, killing the\\ngerms and breaking them down into small pieces that can\\nbe picked up by the circulation and eliminated from the\\nbody. Unfortunately, these chemicals also digest body\\ntissues. In most cases, the germ produces similar chemi-\\ncals. The result is a thick, yellow liquid—pus—contain-\\ning digested germs, digested tissue, white blood cells,\\nand enzymes.\\nAn abscess is the last stage of a tissue infection that\\nbegins with a process called inflammation.

When prostate\\ncancer spreads to other parts of the body, acid phos-\\nphatase levels rise, particularly if the cancer spreads to\\nthe bone.

They produce an oil called sebum, the skin’s natural\\nmoisturizer. These glands and the hair follicles within\\nwhich they are found are called sebaceous follicles.\\nThese follicles open onto the skin through pores.

While Western med-\\nicine typically describes health in terms of measurable\\nphysical processes made up of chemical reactions, the\\nChinese use ideas like yin and yang, chi, the organ sys-\\ntem, and the five elements to describe health and the\\nbody. To understand the ideas behind acupuncture, it is\\nworthwhile to introduce some of these basic terms.',\n",

According to Chinese philosophy,\\nthe universe and the body can be described by two sepa-\\nrate but complementary principles, that of yin and yang.\\nFor example, in temperature, yin is cold and yang is hot.\\nIn gender, yin is female and yang is male. In activity, yin\\nis passive and yang is active. In light, yin is dark and\\nyang is bright; in direction yin is inward and downward\\nand yang is outward and up, and so on. Nothing is ever\\ncompletely yin or yang, but a combination of the two.\\nThese two principles are always interacting, opposing,\\nand influencing each other. The goal of Chinese medi-\\ncine is not to eliminate either yin or yang, but to allow\\nthe two to balance each other and exist harmoniously\\ntogether.

Thus, acupuncture\\ntherapies seek to either increase or reduce yang, or\\nincrease or reduce yin in particular regions of the body.\\nCHI. Another fundamental concept of Chinese med-\\nicine is that of chi (pronounced chee, also spelled qi). Chi\\nis the fundamental life energy of the universe. It is invisi-\\nble and is found in the environment in the air, water, food\\nand sunlight. In the body, it is the invisible vital force\\nthat creates and animates life. We are all born with inher-\\nited amounts of chi, and we also get acquired chi from\\nthe food we eat and the air we breathe. The level and\\nquality of a person’s chi also depends on the state of\\nphysical, mental and emotional balance. Chi travels\\nthrough the body along channels called meridians.',\n",

In the Chinese system, there\\nare twelve main organs: the lung, large intestine, stom-\\nach, spleen, heart, small intestine, urinary bladder, kid-\\nney, liver, gallbladder, pericardium, and the “triple\\nwarmer,” which represents the entire torso region. Each\\norgan has chi energy associated with it, and each organ\\ninteracts with particular emotions on the mental level. As\\nthere are twelve organs, there are twelve types of chi\\nwhich can move through the body, and these move\\nthrough twelve main channels or meridians.

If the kid-\\nney is weak, then there might be a corresponding fire\\nproblem in the heart, so treatment might be made by\\nacupuncture or herbs to cool the heart system and/or\\nincrease energy in the kidney system.\\nThe Chinese have developed an intricate system of\\nhow organs and elements are related to physical and\\nmental symptoms, and the above example is a very sim-\\nple one.

The first thing an\\nacupuncturist will do is get a thorough idea of a patient’s\\nmedical history and symptoms, both physical and emo-\\ntional. This is done with a long questionnaire and inter-\\nview.

The\\nchildhood form of the disease is the classical form and is\\nthe most severe. Childhood ALD is progressive and usu-\\nally leads to total disability or death. It affects only boys\\nbecause the genetic defect is sex-linked (carried on the X\\nchromosome). Onset usually occurs between ages four\\nand ten and can include many different symptoms, not all\\nof which appear together. The most common symptoms\\nare behavioral problems and poor memory. Other symp-\\ntoms frequently seen are loss of vision, seizures, poorly\\narticulated speech, difficulty swallowing, deafness, prob-\\nlems with gait and coordination, fatigue, increased skin\\npigmentation, and progressive dementia.',\n",

Some causes are considered natural, while oth-\\ners signal serious health problems. Some conditions are\\nconfined to the scalp. Others reflect disease throughout\\nthe body. Being plainly visible, the skin and its compo-\\nnents can provide early signs of disease elsewhere in the\\nbody.\\nOftentimes, conditions affecting the skin of the scalp\\nwill result in hair loss. The first clue to the specific cause\\nis the pattern of hair loss, whether it be complete bald-\\nness (alopecia totalis), patchy bald spots, thinning, or\\nhair loss confined to certain areas. Also a factor is the\\ncondition of the hair and the scalp beneath it. Sometimes\\nonly the hair is affected; sometimes the skin is visibly\\ndiseased as well.\\nCauses and symptoms',\n",

Instead of seeing two dif-\\nferent images or double vision (diplopia), the brain sup-\\npresses the blurrier image. This suppression can lead to\\namblyopia. During the first few years of life, preferring\\none eye over the other may lead to poor visual develop-\\nment in the blurrier eye.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nSome of the major causes of amblyopia are as follows:\\n• Strabismus. A misalignment of the eyes (strabismus) is\\nthe most common cause of functional amblyopia. The\\ntwo eyes are looking in two different directions at the\\nsame time. The brain is sent two different images and\\nthis causes confusion. Images from the misaligned or\\n“crossed” eye are turned off to avoid double vision.\\n• Anisometropia.

For\\nexample, one eye may be more nearsighted than the\\nother eye, or one eye may be farsighted and the other\\neye nearsighted. Because the brain cannot fuse the two\\ndissimilar images, the brain will suppress the blurrier\\nimage, causing the eye to become amblyopic.\\n• Cataract. Clouding of the lens of the eye will cause the\\nimage to be blurrier than the other eye. The brain\\n“prefers” the clearer image. The eye with the cataract\\nmay become amblyopic.\\n• Ptosis. This is the drooping of the upper eyelid. If light\\ncannot enter the eye because of the drooping lid, the\\neye is essentially not being used. This can lead to\\namblyopia.\\n• Nutrition.

It\\nis also recommended for women who have already borne\\nchildren with birth defects, or when either of the parents\\nhas a family history of a birth defect for which a diagnos-\\ntic test is available.

Thirty-five is the recommended age to begin\\namnio testing because that is the age at which the risk of\\ncarrying a fetus with such a defect roughly equals the\\nrisk of miscarriage caused by the procedure—about\\none in 200. At age 25, the risk of giving birth to a child\\nwith this type of defect is about one in 1,400; by age 45\\nit increases to about one in 20. Nearly half of all preg-\\nnant women over 35 in the United States undergo\\namniocentesis and many younger women also decide to\\nhave the procedure.

Enzymes are sub-\\nstances made and used by the body to trigger specific\\nchemical reactions. The primary function of the enzyme\\namylase is to break down starches in food so that they\\ncan be used by the body. Amylase testing is usually done\\nto determine the cause of sudden abdominal pain.\\nPurpose\\nAmylase testing is performed to diagnose a number\\nof diseases that elevate amylase levels. Pancreatitis, for\\nexample, is the most common reason for a high amylase\\nlevel. When the pancreas is inflamed, amylase escapes\\nfrom the pancreas into the blood. Within six to 48 hours\\nafter the pain begins, amylase levels in the blood start to\\nrise. Levels will stay high for several days before gradu-\\nally returning to normal.\\nThere are other causes of increased amylase.

be eliminated to prevent\\nbursitis. Overexercising or the repetition of a movement\\nthat triggers the condition should be avoided. Doing exer-\\ncises to strengthen the muscles around the joint will also\\nhelp. When doing repetitive tasks, frequent breaks should\\nbe taken and the activity should be alternated with others\\nusing different parts of the body. To cushion the joints, it\\nis a good idea to use cushioned chairs when sitting and\\nfoam kneeling pads for the knees. Leaning on the elbows,\\nkneeling or sitting on a hard surface for a long period of\\ntime should be avoided. Not wearing high heels can help\\nprevent bursitis in the heel, as can changing to new run-\\nning shoes as soon as the old ones are worn out.\\nResources\\nBOOKS'}}, {'id': 'vec$3419', 'values':

byssinosis. Prolonged exposure makes patients\\nwheeze more often and can cause chronic bronchitis. It\\ndoes not lead to permanently disabling lung disease.\\nPrevention\\nEliminating exposure to textile dust is the surest way\\nto prevent byssinosis. Using exhaust hoods, improving\\nventilation, and employing wetting procedures are very\\nsuccessful methods of controlling dust levels to prevent\\nbyssinosis. Protective equipment required during certain\\nprocedures also prevents exposure to levels of contami-\\nnation that exceed the current United States standard for\\ncotton dust exposure.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nHarrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine.Ed.
